##	Github workflow
1.	Link to repo: https://github.com/BryantCabrera/relocater.  
2.	On your personal repo (NOT the General Assembly) enterprise, log in.  then click link above and fork the repo.  Make sure the repo is in your personal GitHub (go to your personal GitHub account and the project repo “relocater” should be there).  Then, from YOUR PERSONAL FORK, clone it to your local repo.
    1.	$git clone {without curly braces, put the clone link here}
    2.  $git remote add upstream https://github.com/BryantCabrera/relocater
3.	In terminal, cd to the project repo, open it, and $git checkout -b {without these curly braces, put your first name here in all lower case letters}
    1.	EXAMPLE:  $git checkout -b bryant
    2.	**any other time you are changing back to your branch, you don’t need to type the “-b” part anymore
4.	$npm install
    1.	This gets all of the react & express packages downloaded.
5.	FOR EXPRESS: you’re only concerned with the following folders/files
    1.	Controllers
    2.	Db
    3.	Models
    4.	Public
    5.	Routers
    6.	.env
    7.	Server.js
6.	FOR REACT: you’re only concerned with the following folders:
    1.	src (where you will be making ALL components)
    2.	public
7.	When you are 100% sure your data is ready to be merged into the master copy, make sure you are on YOUR OWN BRANCH (lower left of VScode), call Bryant to let him know you're merging, then:
    1.	$git add -A
    2.	$git commit -m “Adds {put your name here}’s {2-3 word description of the feature/code you made}”
    3.  $git push
    4.	$git push origin {without the curlies braces, branchname}
        1.	This passes up the whole branch
    5.  on your PERSONAL GitHub repo, accept and merge the pull requests
8.  Make sure your local repo is always in sync.
    1. make sure you don't have any pending commits, then
    2.  $git checkout master
    3.  $git branch -d {without the curlies braces, your name all in lowercase}
        1. this deletes your old branch
    4. Bryant will let you know when to $git pull upstream master
    5. $git checkout -b {without the curlies braces, your name all in lowercase}
9.	Merging
    1.	On master GitHub link
        1.	Click green button called “compare & pull”
        2.	Create pull request
            (a)	Title: {YourName in all lowercase} –{1-3 word description of new feature/code you made}
            (b)	Description: {line numbers} : Describe in detail what change you made and what it does.
        3.	Click send pull request
    2.	DO NOT hit “merge”, Bryant will be handling this.




##React Documentation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
